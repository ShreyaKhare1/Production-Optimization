  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>In the later stages of lifecycle, the oilfields start facing challenges of declining production. Intervention and stimulation of aging wells is done to maintain their integrity. Aging wells face reservoir and mechanical related problems. The failure of production tubing & rod, corrosion of casing pipes and surface equipment, paraffin and asphalt deposition in tubing, SRP failures and sand deposition are common problems in aging wells. The decline in production can be arrested by deploying suitable artificial lift methods, injecting water into the formation and by deploying enhanced oil recovery techniques.   
  </p>
  <p>By deploying predictive maintenance technologies, the damage to the assets can be reduced. It also helps maintain supply of spares and manpower to right place at right time.
  </p>
  <p>Production forecasting enabled by predictive modelling can enable better planning of assets for storage and transportation of oil and gas. It also gives realistic values of production over an extended period of future time. 
  </p>
  <p>Digital oil field is a concept where all the assets of an oilfield are connected digitally to a control room. It enables central monitoring of production by an asset management team.
